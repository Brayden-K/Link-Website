# Linkit.gg

These are the project files for my website, linkit.gg.

This project was built to handle multiple social media links in one place. Users login and register via the Twitch API.

Users can share all of their social media links in once place. Upgraded users are allowed to add motion and effects to their links.

The UI of your personal link page is completely customizable in the dashboard.
